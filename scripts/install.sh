# Installs, or updates, Dynamic Island from the latest GitHub release:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manu-tech-code/dynamic-island/HEAD/scripts/install.sh | bash
#
# It reads the release feed the app's updater uses, downloads the .dmg with
# curl, checks that the app inside is signed by the project's certificate,
# copies it to Applications and opens it. Files fetched with curl aren't marked
# as downloaded from the internet, so macOS doesn't block the first launch the
# way it does for a browser download. From then on the app updates itself.
#
# Options, as environment variables:
#   DI_INSTALL_DIR=<folder>   install there (default /Applications, or
#                             ~/Applications if /Applications isn't writable)
#   DI_NO_OPEN=1              don't open the app afterwards
